# React-Learning

## Concept
Used for Single Page Applications (SPA). This means that the server only needs to send 1 HTML file to the browser and let React handle the rest, including routing.

This approach doesn't require the server to send HTML page back for every click and hence the faster website performance.

## Recommended Setting for VSC
* Install Simple React Snippets.
* Setting -> Search 'emmet' -> Include Languages -> Add Item -> Item: javascript and Value: javascriptreact. This allows handy shortcuts. Eg: .hello will create a div with class = "hello".
